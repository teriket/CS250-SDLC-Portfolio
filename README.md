    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by identifying types of users -- usually in user personas -- and describing their goals from using an application.  These goals can be described as user stories, succinct action statements that describe a function of an application.  These user stories act as a guide for program implementation.

    How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I develop programs using Agile practices to balance uncertainty.  At the start of a program I set the general direction for development and make concrete plans for core features.  As development continues, I will iterate over the project to implement new features and possibly change the direction of development.

    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Many qualities of being a good team member is described in the Agile Manifesto.  Good team members practice technical excellence, which means developing robust and extensible work products.  Good team members communicate with their team.  Good team members value people and sustainable work practices.  Good team members drive a product forward by identifying roadblocks and potential growth opportunities.
